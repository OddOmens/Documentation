## Tips for Effective Task Management

### Creating Tasks

1. **Be specific** - "Write introduction section" vs "Work on paper"
2. **Set times** - Tasks with times are more likely to be completed
3. **Add context** - Use descriptions for important details
4. **Break down large tasks** - Create multiple smaller tasks

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning review** - Check carried-over tasks
2. **Prioritize** - Tackle important tasks first
3. **Set times** - Schedule when you'll do each task
4. **Evening check** - Complete remaining tasks

### Staying Organized

1. **Complete tasks promptly** - Don't let them pile up
2. **Delete irrelevant tasks** - If it's no longer needed, remove it
3. **Use descriptions** - Add notes for complex tasks
4. **Review weekly** - Clean up old tasks

### Managing Carry-Over

1. **Address old tasks** - Don't ignore carried-over items
2. **Delete if no longer relevant** - It's okay to let go
3. **Break down if too big** - Large tasks are harder to complete
4. **Set specific times** - Scheduled tasks get done

### Time Management

1. **Batch similar tasks** - Group related work together
2. **Use time blocks** - Allocate specific time for tasks
3. **Leave buffer time** - Don't over-schedule
4. **Be realistic** - Don't plan more than you can do
